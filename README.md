# JVMSnippets Examples #

This repository contains examples of libraries and frameworks written in
multiple JVM languages.

The purpose of these examples is allowing experienced Java programmers
to contrast the Java "reference" implementations with their alternative
JVM language counterparts.

Versions implemented JVM languages other than Java aim at exploiting
each language's unique capabilities by implementing the same
functionality in an idiomatic fashion.

Examples are profusely documented to guide the reader in the comparison
between Java and their alternative JVM language(s) of interest.

The first example is [xrecords](xrecords), a small framework for
converting a wide variety of tabular data file formats.
